### Demo:

[See demo](https://yasaman-countries.netlify.app/)

### Bonuses I've had done:

- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode without using any 3rd party libraries
- Searching using the keywords Grmany or Grmny should also work
- Add sort functionality for both Population and Country Name
- Make sure the ratio for the country flags is 4:3 or any other ratio you find suitable
- Store the filters in the URL query strings and sync it with the component filter object
- Add lazy loading for country images and list
